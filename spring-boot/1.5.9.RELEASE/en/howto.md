# Part IX. ‘How-to’ guides

This section provides answers to some common ‘how do I do that…’ questions that often arise when using Spring Boot. Its coverage is not exhaustive, but it does cover quite a lot.

If you have a specific problem that we do not cover here, you might want to check out [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-boot) to see if someone has already provided an answer. This is also a great place to ask new questions (please use the  `spring-boot`  tag).

We are also more than happy to extend this section. If you want to add a ‘how-to’, send us a [pull request](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/v2.1.0.RELEASE).
